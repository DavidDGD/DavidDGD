## Welcome to YData
**Our mission is to help data science teams access and understand their data assets, and produce quality data to sucessfully deploy machine learning models.**

We're the creators of [YData Fabric](https://ydata.ai), the first data-centric platform for data quality. We're also strong advocates of open source software and we're actively developing [ydata-profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling), [ydata-synthetic](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic), and [ydata-quality](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-quality), three open source projects focused on producing high-quality data for machine learning applications. 


You can stay up to date with the latest developments on our [News](https://ydata.ai/resources) or follow our [Medium blog](https://medium.com/ydata-ai) for hands-on tutorials on our open source packages. 


We have a growing community of data scientists on [our Discord Server](http://discord.com/invite/mw7xjJ7b7s), where we discuss emergent topics on **Data Profiling**, **Data Labeling**, and **Synthetic Data**. Join us to share feedback and discuss feature requests! 


You can also find all about our montly events and data initiatives on our [newsletter](https://datacentricai.community/#newsletter) or reach us at developers@ydata.ai.
